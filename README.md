Run npm i --legacy-peer-deps to install all the dependenices. Go to the Sidebar options and click on Multiple Select Field.
To view the code for Multiple Select Field., open the file location src/pages/MultipleSelectInputField/MultiSelectInputField.js

In this code I have used bootstrap/reactstrap to design the layout and make it responsive across all the viewports.
I have used two state arrays i.e options and selectedOptions, options will store details
of all the users, selectedOptions will store details of those users which are converted
into chips. I have used Dropdown feature of bootstrap which creates a dynamic dropdown.
I have used font awesome icons for the user logo. I have taken care of duplicate users, if there are more than two users which
have same name, it will work fine without any errors. I have also created a clear all 
button which will clear all the chips/selected users, but for now I have made it 
display:hidden. I have checked my code, it should meet all the requirements as specified in the google doc,
if there is any improvements then I would appreciate the effort.
